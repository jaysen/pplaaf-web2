<h3>Send us an encrypted email using PGP Encryption</h3>
<p>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a way to protect your email communications from being read by anyone except their
    intended recipients.
</p>

<p>A relatively simple way to send PGP encrypted emails is with the
    <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/en/" target="blank">Mailvelope</a> browser plugin. Mailvelope can be used with popular browser-based email services like Gmail,
    Yahoo and Outlook.com and has comprehensive instructions
    <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/en/help" target="blank">online</a>. We have also recorded a simple
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nsl6DRsTuM" target="blank">video guide</a> to help you get started.</p>

<p>You can send an encrypted email directly to one of the following recipients using the public PGP keys linked
    below:</p>
