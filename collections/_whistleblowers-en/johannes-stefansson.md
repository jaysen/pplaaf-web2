<p>A former manager of Icelandic Samherji, one of the world's largest fishing companies actie across Africa, Stefannson blew the whistle on bribery and corruption involving several Ministers in Namibia and Angola. Through a disclosure of 30 000 confidential emails, documents, contracts and other evidence, Stefansson's disclosure led to the resignation of Namibia's Fisheries Minister Bernhard Esau and Justice Minister Sacky Shanghala, among others. </p>
